# Crossy Road

I created this game because it is one of my favorite arcade games. To make this game, I used the turtle library in Python. In the game, you have two different cars: a normal car and a speedy car. As you progress through the stages, the speed of the cars increases, making it more challenging to continue advancing. I really enjoyed playing this game with my friend, and my highest stage reached is 8. I hope you can beat my record and achieve a higher stage!

## Features

* Two Types of Cars: There are two different types of cars in the game - a normal speed car and a high-speed car.
* Increasing Difficulty: The speed of the cars increases with each stage you pass, adding to the game's difficulty.
* Simple Controls: Use the space bar to move your character forward. Note that it is impossible to move backward; you can only move forward.
* Challenging and Fun: The game is designed to be challenging and enjoyable. Try to beat your highest stage!

## How to play

1. Use the space bar to move your character forward.
2. Avoid getting hit by the cars as you cross the road.
3. Progress through the stages and see how far you can get!

## How to run
